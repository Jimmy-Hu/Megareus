Megareus: A collection of experimental results of various image / video / point cloud processing algorithms

## Abstract

There are more and more datasets and models released nowadays. From the aspects of researching, the exhaustive comparison between models for various data is a hard,  complicated task. From the aspects of application, it's a problem to select a good model from the numerous models / algorithms. Megareus provides a collection of experimental results of open image / video processing algorithms with various published datasets and some of open license data.

## Main Content

There are several kinds of algorithms included in this collection:
